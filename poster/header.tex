% Set up the grid
%
% Note that [40mm,40mm] is the margin round the edge of the page --
% it is _not_ the grid size. That is always defined as 
% PAGE_WIDTH/HGRID and PAGE_HEIGHT/VGRID. In this case we use
% 23 x 12. This gives us three columns of width 7 boxes, with a gap of
% width 1 in between them. 12 vertical boxes is a good number to work
% with.
%
% Note however that texblocks can be positioned fractionally as well,
% so really any convenient grid size can be used.
