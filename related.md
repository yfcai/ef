#### Barry Jay and Simon Peyton Jones: Scrap your type applications

Where I start from. I scrap type abstractions, too.

#### Didier Le Botlan and Didier Rémy: ML^F: Raising ML to the power of System F

[>80 citations.] Their impredicativity is bounded. I am essentially a different, cleaner way of looking at ML^F, I think. We share the motivating example `choose id`.

#### Didier Le Botlan and Didier Rémy: Recasting ML^F

... in precisely the opposite direction as myself! They argue that System F types are not good enough for ML^F, and I'm trying to show that they are.

#### Martin Odersky and Konstantin Läufer: Putting Type Annotations to Work

[>90 citations.] They are predicative.

#### Frank Pfenning: Partial polymorphic type inference and higher-order unification

An undecidable algorithm to leave out even more type annotations. Worth a look!

#### Aleksy Schubert: Second-order unifcation and type inference for Church-style polymorphism

They say it's undecidable. I have to isolate the aspect of myself that makes their proof fail. Otherwise, I can't be decidable either.

#### Mark P. Jones: First-class polymorphism with type inference

They convert nested quantifiers to prenex form. I do the opposite.
