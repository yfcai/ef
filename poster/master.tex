% PROLOGUE
\begin{textblock}{37}(0,0)%
\HEAD{Origin}

The soundness proof of a type system designed for pattern
matching on Church-encoded datatypes turned out to work for many
other type systems.

% maybe some colors eventually?
\begin{CODE}
type List a = forall b. b -> (a -> b -> b) -> b\\
match ::~List a -> b -> (a -> List a -> b) -> b\\
head xs = match xs undefined const\\
tail xs = match xs undefined (const id)\\
\end{CODE}

% WHAT IT IS
\begin{textblock}{30}(0,20)
\HEAD{What is it?}

An extensible notion of type soundness for purely functional
languages, preserved by taking union of type systems.
\end{textblock}

% PRESENT PROBLEM
\begin{textblock}{30}(40,20)
\HEAD{What problem does it solve?}

Interaction between optional language features won't compromise
type soundness.

\begin{CODE}
\def\INDENT{~~~~~~~~~~~~~}
\{-\# LANGUAGE RankNTypes,\\
\INDENT SystemF,\\
\INDENT RecordSubtyping \#-\}
\end{CODE}
\end{textblock}

% FUTURE PROBLEM
\begin{textblock}{30}(80,20)
\HEAD{What problem will it solve?}

It provides a theoretic foundation for future library-based
pluggable type systems.
\end{textblock}

% HOW DOES IT WORK
\begin{textblock}{50}(0,48)
\HEAD{How does it work?}

A system of pluggable ideals must make the correspondence
explicit:

{
\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{l@{\hskip 1.5cm}l}
Syntax &
Semantics
\\
Term $\lambda x:\mathrm{Nat}.~x$ &
Identity function in domain $V\simeq B+[V\rightarrow V]$
\\
Type $\mathrm{Nat}$ &
The ideal $\{\bot,0,1,\ldots\}$, a nonempty closed
\\
Judgement $t:T$ &
Statement ``the value denoted by $t$ belongs to $T$''
\\
Typing rule $5:\mathrm{Nat}$ &
Lemma ``5 is a natural number''
\\
Derivations &
Proofs
\end{tabular}
}

Typing terms with rules from multiple systems amounts to writing
proofs with a larger collection of lemmas.
